# Example Notebooks

Five end-to-end tutorials covering all scJDO workflows.
Each notebook uses the high-level API — 4–6 function calls, no boilerplate.

| # | Notebook | Dataset | Analysis | Key outputs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 01 | `01_paul15_hybrid_drift_tutorial` | Paul15 hematopoiesis | Drift field + archetypes + instability genes + regulators | `summary_figure`, instability CSV, regulator network |
| 02 | `02_paul15_fourier_tutorial` | Paul15 hematopoiesis | Fourier-domain score network, spectral band decomposition, generated cell validation | Real vs generated power spectrum, band gene lists |
| 03 | `03_schrodinger_bridge_tutorial` | 2D synthetic | Bridge on Gaussian source → target, forward/backward instability, de novo network edges | Trajectory plots, instability asymmetry table |
| 04 | `04_paul15_schrodinger_tutorial` | Paul15 hematopoiesis | Bridge in 50-D PCA space, forward (differentiation) vs backward (de-differentiation) instability genes and regulators | Gene tables (forward/backward), hybrid regulator network |
| 05 | `05_scopatlas_complete_workflow` | Your data + pre-trained model | Stable-operator atlas: operator metrics, embedding, clustering, biological interpretation | Operator regime UMAP, clustering comparison, regime statistics |

## Running the notebooks

```bash
conda activate scJDO
jupyter lab
```

Start with **01** — it covers the core workflow end-to-end.
Notebooks 03 and 04 use the same Schrödinger Bridge model; 03 is pedagogical (2D),
04 is the real-data version.

## Data

Paul15 hematopoiesis data (`data/paul15/paul15.h5`) is fetched automatically via
`scanpy.datasets.paul15()` — no manual download needed.

Large generated files (model checkpoints `*.pt`, processed datasets `*.h5ad`) are
excluded from version control. Run the notebooks to regenerate them.
