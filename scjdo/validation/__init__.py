scjdo.validation
==================
Reviewer-response validation utilities for the scJDO manuscript.

Submodules
----------
null_models
    Temporal shuffle and continuous-control null models to verify that
    archetype coordination motifs are not artifacts of low-rank
    factorization.

robustness
    Gene-level Jaccard overlap and Spearman rank correlation across
    different pseudotime methods (DPT, Palantir, Slingshot).

identifiability
    Utilities for quantifying what is and is not identifiable in the
    scJDO operator framework: archetype cosine similarity across runs,
    instability peak timing, and model-sensitivity reports.
